# EIGHTY-SIX
Eighty-Six is a novel that is now animated

> This is a really good read as Eighty-Six portrays a dystopian world where they are under siege by an army of mechs, and in return, they fight these mechs with their mechs.

On the surface, this is all that is

## However, let us dive in deeper ##

In the World of Eighty-Six, it starts by describing the people of the **Republic of San Magnolia**. These people are the ***Alba***, known for their pale hair, features, and complexion. There is a war between the **Republic of San Magnolia** and the **Empire of Gia**d, the Empire from which the mechs called the ***Legions*** hail. However, the Empire has long been dead, and the mechanized Legion are powered by their selves. 
The Republic reports that there were no *human* deaths however, that report is false as the ones fighting against the Legion are the **86** who fight with their mechs called the ***"Juggernauts"***.

Who are these ***Eighty-Sixers?*** These people have colors on their skin, hair, and features. Basically, it's kind of like a white supremacist thing. The 86'ers were not originally discriminated against. Before the war, they had equal rights but when the war came, the ***Alba-supremacists*** pushed them out and left them out of the Republic like they were cannon fodder to fight against the Legion. They call these people pigs.  

The plot is intriguing, especially once you get to know **Shin** ~~best boy~~ who is called ***"The Reaper"***. Every one of his comrades who are about to die on the battlefield is met with his gun ~~*bang*~~. Now this may sound insensitive but the fact that the 86 are sent out like pigs to slaughter, is seen as a mercy especially if you know the additional reason as the story progresses ~~they get integrated into the legion and Shin hears the cries of the dead due to his weird superpower~~. 

This is just a glimpse of the series itself, it is much better when you watch and read it.
